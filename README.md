# Konexio-mern-stack
New Konexio web service based off of a mern-stack boilerplate created by Stanford Code the Change.

# How this works!
This website's codebase is split into two directories: client (for the front-end/design part) and server (for the backend). The instructions to set up each part can be found within their directories.

# (important) jwt secret
type this in terminal in the main folder: 
"echo "JWT_SECRET=msgmeforthejwtsecret" >> ./server/src/.env"
